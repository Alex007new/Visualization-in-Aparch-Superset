# Visualization-in-Aparch-Superset

Some examples of basic dashboards made in Apache Superset are presented.  

***'Main dashboard'*** and ***'Operational dashboard'*** are basic dashboards covering key product metrics. If a company, for example, has not yet built analytical processes, it would probably be a mistake to immediately start solving some product problems, come up with A / B tests, etc. It is necessary to make sure that we can answer the simplest questions about our application without difficulty and manual uploads.  

***'Interaction of two services_news feed and messaging service'*** is an attempt to create a dashboard that describes the interaction of two services - feed and messages.
