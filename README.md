# Visualization-in-Aparch-Superset

Some examples of basic dashboards made in Apache Superset are presented.  

***'Main dashboard'*** and ***'Operational dashboard'*** are basic dashboards covering key product metrics. If a company, for example, has not yet built analytical processes, it would probably be a mistake to immediately start solving some product problems, come up with A / B tests, etc. It is necessary to make sure that we can answer the simplest questions about our application without difficulty and manual uploads.  

***'Interaction of two services_news feed and messaging service'*** is an attempt to create a dashboard that describes the interaction of two services - feed and messages.

The dashboard ***'Some particular tasks'*** contains several implementations related to the _Retention rate_ and _Churn rate_ metrics: visualization of Retention by slice ‘source’; the classic version of retention visualization through a heat map; a graph that allows you to look at the active audience from the point of view of new, old and departed users (new - the first activity in the feed was this week, old - there was activity both this and last week, gone - there was activity last week, on this one was not).

***'Alert_system_dashboard'*** is intended to serve as a source of additional information when building a more advanced (compared to previously posted) notification system for our application.
